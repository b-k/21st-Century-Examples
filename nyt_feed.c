/** \mainpage
The front page of the Grey Lady's web site is as gaudy as can be, including
several headlines and sections trying to get your attention, various formatting
schemes, and even photographs--in <em>color</em>.

This program reads in the NYT Headlines RSS feed, and writes a simple list in
plain HTML. You can then click through to the headline that modestly piques
your attention.

For notes on compilation, see the \ref compilation page.

/** \page compilation Compiling the program

Save the following code to \c makefile.

Notice that cURL has a program, \c curl-config, that behaves like \c pkg-config,
but is cURL-specific.

\code
CFLAGS =-g -Wall -O3  `curl-config --cflags` -I/usr/include/libxml2
LDLIBS=`curl-config --libs ` -lxml2
CC=c99

nyt_feed:
\endcode

Having saved your makefile, use <tt>make nyt_feed</tt> to compile.

Of course, you have to have the development packages for libcurl and libxml2
installed for this to work.
